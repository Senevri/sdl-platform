# SDL-platform

uses SDL2, SDL2_Mixer, SDL2_TTF;

Audio, sprites, user input.

Notes:
If compiling with build.bat, be sure to set the directories appropriately.
closer.mod is by Groo, of CNCD. google for it, drop inside assets.
or just use a mod or ogg file of your choice.

Seems to work with 2.0.5 precompiled VC thingies.

Problem with getting the font to work.
